# Alpha-Strike

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the website https://frontier.alpha-strike.space/ and it's subsequent application programmer interface (api) https://api.alpha-strike.space/documentation/. It is our goal to maintain a leaderboard, colloquially known as a Killboard, for the greater [Eve Frontier](https://www.evefrontier.com/en) gaming community. 

The vast majority of our project is open source. This makes documentation easily accessible for us from all locations through any modality. It also helps us to improve our knowledge base and expand our project in ways we might not have thought of before. 
Feel free to have a look around and make a pull request to add to the many features on our website. We not only welcome you, but challenge you to make a lasting impact in this open source project.
